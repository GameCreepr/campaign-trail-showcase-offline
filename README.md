# Campaign Trail Showcase: Offline Edition
With the UK blocking imgur, plus the rampant link rot in older mods, I have have decided to adapt various TCT mods to have links point to lcoally hosted files instead of web links. This lets mods last longer since they wont be reliant on file hosts staying online, plus acts as an alternative for those who for whatever reason can't access those file hosts. 

## Preparing
1. Download a zip of the [CTS git](https://github.com/campaign-trail-showcase/campaign-trail-showcase.github.io)
2. From the zip file in the latest CTS-O release, copy the folders from the root of the zip file into the root of the extracted CTS files (such that the folders merge, and files are replaced)
3. Optionally, you can delete the original mod folder to clear up space before replacing with the new files, but this is not necessary

## Running
Open cmd in the root of your TCT folder, and with Python installed, run the command `py -m http.server 8000`, starting a locally hosted version of TCT. Now, you can play TCT at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) the same as you would with the regular websites, except everything is already downloaded. Ctrl + C or closing the command prompt stops the host; if youre having issues with loading files properly, clear your browser cache.

## Mod list:
- American Carnage
### To-do:
